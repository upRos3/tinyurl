# TinyApp

A functional link shortening web application to be used where character real estate is limited.

## Getting Started

Everything is ready to go. All you will need to run this application are the prequisties that can be found below and in the package.json file.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```
* Node.js
* Express
* EJS
* bcrypt
* body-parser
* cookie-session
```

### Installing

```
In your node.js terminal, the 'npm install' command should download all required dependencies. Please refer to the prerequisites to ensure all packages are installed.
```

## Running the server

With nodemon installed, execute 'npm start' in any folder within the repository to start listening.

## Versioning

This is version 1.0.0. Unfortunatly due to time constraints, visually the web application is lacking, but I will be looking to update the app in future to not only add more functionality but also create a better and visually appealing UX.
